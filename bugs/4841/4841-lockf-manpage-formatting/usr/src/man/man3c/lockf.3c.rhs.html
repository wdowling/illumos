  10 .TH LOCKF 3C "Apr 10, 2002"
  11 .SH NAME
  12 lockf \- record locking on files
  13 .SH SYNOPSIS
  14 .LP
  15 .nf
  16 #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
  17 
  18 \fBint\fR \fBlockf\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfildes\fR, \fBint\fR \fIfunction\fR, \fBoff_t\fR \fIsize\fR);
  19 .fi
  20 
  21 .SH DESCRIPTION
  22 .sp
  23 .LP
  24 The \fBlockf()\fR function allows sections of a file to be locked; advisory or
  25 mandatory write locks depending  on the mode bits of the file (see
  26 \fBchmod\fR(2)). Calls to \fBlockf()\fR from other threads that attempt to lock
  27 the locked file section will either return an error value or be put to sleep
  28 until the resource becomes unlocked. All the locks for a process are removed
  29 when the process terminates. See \fBfcntl\fR(2) for more information about
  30 record locking.
  31 .sp
  32 .LP
  33 The \fIfildes\fR argument is an open file descriptor. The file descriptor must
  34 have \fBO_WRONLY\fR or \fBO_RDWR\fR permission in order to establish locks with
  35 this function call.
  36 .sp
  37 .LP
<a name="1" id="anc1"></a><span class="changed">  38 The \fIfunction\fR argument is a control value that specifies the action to be</span>
<span class="changed">  39 taken. The permissible values for \fIfunction\fR are defined in</span>
  40 &lt;\fBunistd.h\fR&gt; as follows:
  41 .sp
  42 .in +2
  43 .nf
  44 #define   F_ULOCK   0   /* unlock previously locked section */
  45 #define   F_LOCK    1   /* lock section for exclusive use */
  46 #define   F_TLOCK   2   /* test &amp; lock section for exclusive use */
  47 #define   F_TEST    3   /* test section for other locks */
  48 .fi
  49 .in -2
  50 
  51 .sp
  52 .LP
<a name="2" id="anc2"></a><span class="changed">  53 All other values of \fIfunction\fR are reserved for future extensions and will</span>
  54 result in an error if not implemented.
  55 .sp
  56 .LP
  57 \fBF_TEST\fR is used to detect if a lock by another process is present on the
  58 specified section. \fBF_LOCK\fR and \fBF_TLOCK\fR both lock a section of a file
  59 if the section is available. \fBF_ULOCK\fR removes locks from a section of the
  60 file.
  61 .sp
  62 .LP
<a name="3" id="anc3"></a><span class="changed">  63 The \fIsize\fR argument is the number of contiguous bytes to be locked or</span>
  64 unlocked. The resource to be locked or unlocked starts at the current offset in
<a name="4" id="anc4"></a><span class="changed">  65 the file and extends forward for a positive \fIsize\fR and backward for a negative</span>
<span class="changed">  66 \fIsize\fR (the preceding bytes up to but not including the current offset). If</span>
<span class="changed">  67 \fIsize\fR is zero, the section from the current offset through the largest</span>
  68 file offset is locked (that is, from the current offset through the present or
  69 any future end-of-file). An area need not be allocated to the file in order to
  70 be locked as such locks may exist past the end-of-file.
  71 .sp
  72 .LP
  73 The sections locked with \fBF_LOCK\fR or \fBF_TLOCK\fR may, in whole or in
  74 part, contain or be contained by a previously locked section for the same
  75 process.  Locked sections will be unlocked starting at the point of the offset
<a name="5" id="anc5"></a><span class="changed">  76 through \fIsize\fR bytes or to the end of file if \fIsize\fR is (\fBoff_t\fR)</span>
  77 0. When this situation occurs, or if this situation occurs in adjacent
  78 sections, the sections are combined into a single section. If the request
  79 requires that a new element be added to the table of active locks and this
  80 table is already full, an error is returned, and the new section is not locked.
  81 .sp
  82 .LP
  83 \fBF_LOCK\fR and \fBF_TLOCK\fR requests differ only by the action taken if the
  84 resource is not available. \fBF_LOCK\fR blocks the calling thread until the
  85 resource is available. \fBF_TLOCK\fR causes the function to return \(mi1 and
  86 set \fBerrno\fR to \fBEAGAIN\fR if the section is already locked by another
  87 process.
  88 .sp
  89 .LP
  90 File locks are released on first close by the locking process of any file
  91 descriptor for the file.
  92 .sp
  93 .LP
  94 \fBF_ULOCK\fR requests may, in whole or in part, release one or more locked
  95 sections controlled by the process. When sections are not fully released, the
  96 remaining sections are still locked by the process. Releasing the center
  97 section of a locked section requires an additional element in the table of
  98 active locks. If this table is full, an \fBerrno\fR is set to \fBEDEADLK\fR and
  99 the requested section is not released.
 100 .sp
 101 .LP
<a name="6" id="anc6"></a><span class="changed"> 102 An \fBF_ULOCK\fR request in which \fIsize\fR is non-zero and the offset of the</span>
 103 last byte of the requested section is the maximum value for an object of type
<a name="7" id="anc7"></a><span class="changed"> 104 \fBoff_t\fR, when the process has an existing lock in which \fIsize\fR is 0 and</span>

 107 0. Otherwise, an \fBF_ULOCK\fR request will attempt to unlock only the
 108 requested section.
 109 .sp
 110 .LP
 111 A potential for deadlock occurs if the threads of a process controlling a
 112 locked resource is put to sleep by requesting another process's locked
 113 resource. Thus calls to \fBlockf()\fR or \fBfcntl\fR(2) scan for a deadlock
 114 prior to sleeping on a locked resource. An error return is made if sleeping on
 115 the locked resource would cause a deadlock.
 116 .sp
 117 .LP
 118 Sleeping on a resource is interrupted with any signal. The \fBalarm\fR(2)
 119 function may be used to provide a timeout facility in applications that require
 120 this facility.
 121 .SH RETURN VALUES
 122 .sp
 123 .LP
 124 Upon successful completion, \fB0\fR is returned.  Otherwise, \fB\(mi1\fR is
 125 returned and \fBerrno\fR is set to indicate the error.

 235 .SH USAGE
 236 .sp
 237 .LP
 238 Record-locking should not be used in combination with the \fBfopen\fR(3C),
 239 \fBfread\fR(3C), \fBfwrite\fR(3C) and other \fBstdio\fR functions.  Instead,
 240 the more primitive, non-buffered functions (such as \fBopen\fR(2)) should be
 241 used.  Unexpected results may occur in processes that do buffering in the user
 242 address space.  The process may later read/write data which is/was locked.  The
 243 \fBstdio\fR functions are the most common source of unexpected buffering.
 244 .sp
 245 .LP
 246 The \fBalarm\fR(2) function may be used to provide a timeout facility in
 247 applications requiring it.
 248 .sp

 250 The \fBlockf()\fR function has a transitional interface for 64-bit file
 251 offsets.  See \fBlf64\fR(5).
