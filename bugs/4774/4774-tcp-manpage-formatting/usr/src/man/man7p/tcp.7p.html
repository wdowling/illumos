  42 .SH DESCRIPTION
  43 .sp
  44 .LP
  45 \fBTCP\fR is the virtual circuit protocol of the Internet protocol family. It
  46 provides reliable, flow-controlled, in order, two-way transmission of data. It
  47 is a byte-stream protocol layered above the Internet Protocol (\fBIP\fR), or
  48 the Internet Protocol Version 6 (\fBIPv6\fR), the Internet protocol family's
  49 internetwork datagram delivery protocol.
  50 .sp
  51 .LP
  52 Programs can access \fBTCP\fR using the socket interface as a \fBSOCK_STREAM\fR
  53 socket type, or using the Transport Level Interface (\fBTLI\fR) where it
  54 supports the connection-oriented (\fBT_COTS_ORD\fR) service type.
  55 .sp
  56 .LP
  57 \fBTCP\fR uses \fBIP\fR's host-level addressing and adds its own per-host
  58 collection of "port addresses." The endpoints of a \fBTCP\fR connection are
  59 identified by the combination of an \fBIP\fR or IPv6 address and a \fBTCP\fR
  60 port number. Although other protocols, such as the User Datagram Protocol
  61 (UDP), may use the same host and port address format, the port space of these
  62 protocols is distinct. See \fBinet\fR(7P) and \fBinet6\fR(7P) for details on
  63 the common aspects of addressing in the Internet protocol family.
  64 .sp
  65 .LP
  66 Sockets utilizing \fBTCP\fR are either "active" or "passive." Active sockets
  67 initiate connections to passive sockets. Both types of sockets must have their
  68 local \fBIP\fR or IPv6 address and \fBTCP\fR port number bound with the
  69 \fBbind\fR(3SOCKET) system call after the socket is created. By default,
  70 \fBTCP\fR sockets are active. A passive socket is created by calling the
  71 \fBlisten\fR(3SOCKET) system call after binding the socket with \fBbind()\fR.
  72 This establishes a queueing parameter for the passive socket. After this,
  73 connections to the passive socket can be received with the
  74 \fBaccept\fR(3SOCKET) system call. Active sockets use the
  75 \fBconnect\fR(3SOCKET) call after binding to initiate connections.
  76 .sp
  77 .LP
  78 By using the special value \fBINADDR_ANY\fR with \fBIP\fR, or the unspecified
  79 address (all zeroes) with IPv6, the local \fBIP\fR address can be left
  80 unspecified in the \fBbind()\fR call by either active or passive \fBTCP\fR
  81 sockets. This feature is usually used if the local address is either unknown or
  82 irrelevant. If left unspecified, the local \fBIP\fR or IPv6 address will be
  83 bound at connection time to the address of the network interface used to
  84 service the connection.
  85 .sp
  86 .LP
  87 Note that no two TCP sockets can be bound to the same port unless the bound IP
  88 addresses are different.  IPv4 \fBINADDR_ANY\fR and IPv6 unspecified addresses
  89 compare as equal to any IPv4 or IPv6 address. For example, if a socket is bound
  90 to \fBINADDR_ANY\fR or unspecified address and port X, no other socket can bind
  91 to port X, regardless of the binding address. This special consideration of
  92 \fBINADDR_ANY\fR and unspecified address can be changed using the socket option
  93 \fBSO_REUSEADDR\fR. If \fBSO_REUSEADDR\fR is set on a socket doing a bind, IPv4
  94 \fBINADDR_ANY\fR and IPv6 unspecified address do not compare as equal to any IP
  95 address. This means that as long as the two sockets are not both bound to
  96 \fBINADDR_ANY\fR/unspecified address or the same IP address, the two sockets
  97 can be bound to the same port.
  98 .sp
  99 .LP
 100 If an application does not want to allow another socket  using the
 101 \fBSO_REUSEADDR\fR option to bind to a port its socket is bound to, the
 102 application can set the socket level option \fBSO_EXCLBIND\fR on a socket. The
 103 option values of 0 and 1 mean enabling and disabling the option respectively.
 104 Once this option is enabled on a socket, no other socket can be bound to the
 105 same port.
 106 .sp
 107 .LP
 108 Once a connection has been established, data can be exchanged using the
 109 \fBread\fR(2) and \fBwrite\fR(2) system calls.
 110 .sp
 111 .LP
 112 Under most circumstances, \fBTCP\fR sends data when it is presented. When
 113 outstanding data has not yet been acknowledged, \fBTCP\fR gathers small amounts
 114 of output to be sent in a single packet once an acknowledgement has been
 115 received. For a small number of clients, such as window systems that send a
 116 stream of mouse events which receive no replies, this packetization may cause
 117 significant delays. To circumvent this problem, \fBTCP\fR provides a
 118 socket-level boolean option, \fBTCP_NODELAY.\fR \fBTCP_NODELAY\fR is defined in
 119 \fB&lt;netinet/tcp.h&gt;\fR, and is set with \fBsetsockopt\fR(3SOCKET) and tested
 120 with \fBgetsockopt\fR(3SOCKET). The option level for the \fBsetsockopt()\fR
 121 call is the protocol number for \fBTCP,\fR available from
 122 \fBgetprotobyname\fR(3SOCKET).
 123 .sp
 124 .LP
 125 For some applications, it may be desirable for TCP not to send out data unless
 126 a full TCP segment can be sent. To enable this behavior, an application can use
 127 the \fBTCP_CORK\fR socket option. When \fBTCP_CORK\fR is set with a non-zero
 128 value, TCP sends out a full TCP segment only. When \fBTCP_CORK\fR is set to
 129 zero after it has been enabled, all buffered data is sent out (as permitted by
 130 the peer's receive window and the current congestion window). \fBTCP_CORK\fR is
 131 defined in &lt;\fBnetinet/tcp.h\fR&gt;,  and is set with \fBsetsockopt\fR(3SOCKET)
 132 and tested with \fBgetsockopt\fR(3SOCKET). The option level for the
 133 \fBsetsockopt()\fR call is the protocol  number  for TCP, available from
 134 \fBgetprotobyname\fR(3SOCKET).
 135 .sp
 136 .LP
 137 The SO_RCVBUF socket level option can be used to control the window that TCP
 138 advertises to the peer. IP level options may also be used with TCP. See
 139 \fBip\fR(7P) and \fBip6\fR(7P).
 140 .sp
 141 .LP
 142 Another socket level option, \fBSO_RCVBUF,\fR can be used to control the window
 143 that \fBTCP\fR advertises to the peer. \fBIP\fR level options may also be used
 144 with \fBTCP.\fR See \fBip\fR(7P) and \fBip6\fR(7P).
 145 .sp
 146 .LP
 147 \fBTCP\fR provides an urgent data mechanism, which may be invoked using the
 148 out-of-band provisions of \fBsend\fR(3SOCKET). The caller may mark one byte as
 149 "urgent" with the \fBMSG_OOB\fR flag to \fBsend\fR(3SOCKET). This sets an
 150 "urgent pointer" pointing to this byte in the \fBTCP\fR stream. The receiver on
 151 the other side of the stream is notified of the urgent data by a \fBSIGURG\fR
 152 signal. The \fBSIOCATMARK\fR \fBioctl\fR(2) request returns a value indicating
 153 whether the stream is at the urgent mark. Because the system never returns data
 154 across the urgent mark in a single \fBread\fR(2) call, it is possible to
 155 advance to the urgent data in a simple loop which reads data, testing the
 156 socket with the \fBSIOCATMARK\fR \fBioctl()\fR request, until it reaches the
 157 mark.
 158 .sp
 159 .LP
 160 Incoming connection requests that include an \fBIP\fR source route option are
 161 noted, and the reverse source route is used in responding.
 162 .sp
 163 .LP
 164 A checksum over all data helps \fBTCP\fR implement reliability. Using a
 165 window-based flow control mechanism that makes use of positive
 166 acknowledgements, sequence numbers, and a retransmission strategy, \fBTCP\fR
 167 can usually recover when datagrams are damaged, delayed, duplicated or
 168 delivered out of order by the underlying communication medium.
 169 .sp
 170 .LP
 171 If the local \fBTCP\fR receives no acknowledgements from its peer for a period
 172 of time, (for example, if the remote machine crashes), the connection is closed
 173 and an error is returned.
 174 .sp
 175 .LP
 176 TCP follows the congestion control algorithm described in \fIRFC 2581\fR, and
 177 also supports the initial congestion window (cwnd) changes in \fIRFC 3390\fR.
 178 The initial cwnd calculation can be overridden by the socket option
 179 TCP_INIT_CWND. An application can use this option to set the initial cwnd to a
 180 specified number of TCP segments. This applies to the cases when the connection
 181 first starts and restarts after an idle period.  The process must have the
 182 PRIV_SYS_NET_CONFIG privilege if it wants to specify a number greater than that
 183 calculated by \fIRFC 3390\fR.
 184 .sp
 185 .LP
 186 SunOS supports \fBTCP\fR Extensions for High Performance (\fIRFC 1323\fR) which
 187 includes the window scale and timestamp options, and Protection Against Wrap
 188 Around Sequence Numbers (PAWS). SunOS also supports Selective Acknowledgment
 189 (SACK) capabilities (RFC 2018) and Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
 190 mechanism (\fIRFC 3168\fR).

 200 the program calls \fBlisten()\fR or \fBconnect()\fR, because the window scale
 201 option is negotiated when the connection is established. Once the connection
 202 has been made, it is too late to increase the send or receive window beyond the

 233 \fBSACK\fR or send out \fBSACK\fR information. If \fBtcp_sack_permitted\fR is
 234 set to \fB1\fR, \fBTCP\fR will not initiate a connection with \fBSACK\fR
 235 permitted option in the \fBSYN\fR segment, but will respond with \fBSACK\fR
 236 permitted option in the \fBSYN|ACK\fR segment if an incoming connection request
 237 has the \fBSACK \fR permitted option. This means that \fBTCP\fR will only
 238 accept \fBSACK\fR information if the other side of the connection also accepts
 239 \fBSACK\fR information. If \fBtcp_sack_permitted\fR is set to \fB2\fR, it will
 240 both initiate and accept connections with \fBSACK\fR information. The default
 241 for \fBtcp_sack_permitted\fR is \fB2\fR (active enabled).

 252 peer that supports \fBECN\fR mechanism. If \fBtcp_ecn_permitted\fR is set to
 253 \fB1\fR when initiating a connection, TCP will not tell a peer that it supports
 254 ECN mechanism. However, it will tell a peer that it supports \fBECN\fR
 255 mechanism when accepting a new incoming connection request if the peer
 256 indicates that it supports \fBECN\fR mechanism in the SYN segment. If
 257 tcp_ecn_permitted is set to 2, in addition to negotiating with a peer on ECN
 258 mechanism when accepting connections, TCP will indicate in the outgoing SYN
 259 segment that it supports \fBECN\fR mechanism when \fBTCP\fR makes active
 260 outgoing connections. The default for \fBtcp_ecn_permitted\fR is 1.

 304 SunOS also supports multiple methods of generating initial sequence numbers.
 305 One of these methods is the improved technique suggested in \fBRFC\fR 1948. We
 306 \fBHIGHLY\fR recommend that you set sequence number generation parameters as
 307 close to boot time as possible. This prevents sequence number problems on
 308 connections that use the same connection-ID as ones that used a different
 309 sequence number generation. The \fBsvc:/network/initial:default\fR service
 310 configures the initial sequence number generation.  The service reads the value
 311 contained in the configuration file \fB/etc/default/inetinit\fR to determine
 312 which method to use.
 313 .sp
 314 .LP
 315 The \fB/etc/default/inetinit\fR file is an unstable interface, and may change
 316 in future releases.
 317 .sp
 318 .LP
 319 \fBTCP\fR may be configured to report some information on connections that
 320 terminate by means of an \fBRST\fR packet. By default, no logging is done. If
 321 the \fBndd\fR(1M) parameter \fItcp_trace\fR is set to 1, then trace data is
 322 collected for all new connections established after that time.
 323 .sp
 324 .LP
 325 The trace data consists of the \fBTCP\fR headers and \fBIP\fR source and
 326 destination addresses of the last few packets sent in each direction before RST
 327 occurred. Those packets are logged in a series of \fBstrlog\fR(9F) calls. This
 328 trace facility has a very low overhead, and so is superior to such utilities as
 329 \fBsnoop\fR(1M) for non-intrusive debugging for connections terminating by
 330 means of an \fBRST\fR.
 331 .sp
 332 .LP
 333 SunOS supports the keep-alive mechanism described in \fIRFC 1122\fR. It is
 334 enabled using the socket option SO_KEEPALIVE. When enabled, the first
 335 keep-alive probe is sent out after a TCP is idle for two hours If the peer does
 336 not respond to the probe within eight minutes, the TCP connection is aborted.
 337 You can alter the interval for sending out the first probe using the socket
 338 option TCP_KEEPALIVE_THRESHOLD. The option value is an unsigned integer in
 339 milliseconds. The system default is controlled by the TCP ndd parameter
 340 tcp_keepalive_interval. The minimum value is ten seconds. The maximum is ten
 341 days, while the default is two hours. If you receive no response to the probe,
 342 you can use the TCP_KEEPALIVE_ABORT_THRESHOLD socket option to change the time
 343 threshold for aborting a TCP connection. The option value is an unsigned
 344 integer in milliseconds. The value zero indicates that TCP should never time
 345 out and abort the connection when probing. The system default is controlled by
 346 the TCP ndd parameter tcp_keepalive_abort_interval. The default is eight
 347 minutes.
 348 .sp
 349 .LP
 350 socket options TCP_KEEPIDLE, TCP_KEEPCNT and TCP_KEEPINTVL are also supported
 351 for compatibility with other Unix Flavors. TCP_KEEPIDLE option specifies the
 352 interval in seconds for sending out the first keep-alive probe. TCP_KEEPCNT
 353 specifies the number of keep-alive probes to be sent before aborting the
 354 connection in the event of no response from peer. TCP_KEEPINTVL specifies the
 355 interval in seconds between successive keep-alive probes.
