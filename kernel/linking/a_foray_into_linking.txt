A Foray in to Linking
---------------------

The final step in generating an application is to link it. But link to what?
Well it must be linked to any library required to produce an executable. On
illumos there are two types of linking - static and dynamic. The program `ld` 
performs the linking. It exists under the directory usr/src/cmd/sgs/ld. 

Dynamic Linking
---------------
* Allow libraries to be shared among multiple applications and loaded when
  needed.
* Libraries optimized for a particular platform are picked up at runtime.
* Can investigate runtime behaviour and examine function calls.
* Dynamic libraries can be changed without changing the application.
* Postfix .so for "shared object".

Static Linking
--------------
* Slightly better performance over dynamic libraries.
* Easier to track what code was called.
* Postfix .a for "archive".

System libraries are now only available as dynamic libraries.
